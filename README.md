# Flight-Reservation-System

This is a simple flight reservation system which I created. It is able to save lots of differnet flights which an admin enters into the system.
The customers must then create an account and can add flights to their account and can also remove them. 

Additional features I plan to add:
1. Database which allows the flights created to be persitent 
2. Ability to stop someone from booking a flight if all the seats are full
3. GUI interface
